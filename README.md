# To-Do-List
To-Do List is the traditional way to organize the tasks land to start a journey as a frontend developer

This is my first frontend project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s a simple **To-Do List** app that helps you add, delete, and manage daily tasks — and all your data is saved using **Local Storage**, so it stays even after refreshing the page.
